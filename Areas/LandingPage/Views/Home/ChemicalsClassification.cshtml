                                        Specialty Chemicals, also known as performance chemicals, are low-volume but high-value compounds. These chemicals are derived from basic chemicals and are sold on the basis of their functions. For example, paints, adhesives, electronic chemicals, water management chemicals, oilfield chemicals, flavours and fragrances, rubber additives, paper additives, industrial cleaners and fine chemicals, sealants, coatings, catalysts etc. come under this category.

                                        Basic petro-chemicals include synthetic fibers, polymers, rubber (elastomer), synthetic detergent intermediates, and performance plastics. Intermediate petro-chemicals include synthetic fiber intermediates, olefins, and aromatics. Olefins and aromatics are, nevertheless, generally categorized as components of building blocks. The following is a summary of olefins and aromatics:-

                                        Olefin, also called as alkenes contains one or more pairs of carbon atoms linked by a double bond. Examples include ethylene, propylene and butadiene. Both ethylene and propylene are used in the industrial production of chemicals, plastics and plastics products while butadiene is used in the industrial production of synthetic rubber.

                                        Aromatics are hydrocarbons derived from petroleum, characterized by a ring-like molecular structure. Examples include benzene, toluene, and xylene. Benzene is used in making dyes as well as in making synthetic detergents. A combination of benzene and toluene are used in making isocyanates which are required in making polyurethanes while xylenes are used in the industrial production of both plastics and synthetic fibres.
